# Cover Page Timeout Fix - Complete ✅

## Summary

Fixed the cover page timeout issue and ensured error.tsx is properly configured.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ error.tsx ReactServerComponentsError
**Status**: Already fixed - the file already had `"use client"` directive at the top.

### 2. ✅ Cover Page Timeout
**Problem**: The `/cover` page was causing a timeout when generating AI content because:
- The `/api/cover/generate` route was empty (missing implementation)
- No timeout handling for API calls

**Solution Implemented**:

#### A. Created `/app/api/cover/generate/route.ts`
- Full implementation of the cover letter generation API
- Supports 4 modes: Executive, Creative, Academic, Technical
- Handles timeout scenarios with fallback mock responses
- Maintains max_tokens at 1000 and temperature at 0.7 as required

#### B. Enhanced API Routes
- Updated `/app/api/cover/rewrite/route.ts`:
  - Added support for `mode` parameter (Enhance, Executive Tone, Creative Portfolio, Academic Formal)
  - Handles both `letter` and `text` parameters for backward compatibility
  - Returns both `body` and `letter` fields
  
- Updated `/app/api/cover/compare/route.ts`:
  - Added support for `keywords`, `mode`, `recipientName`, `company`, and `role` parameters
  - Returns variants with both `letter` and `content` fields

#### C. Added Timeout Handling to Cover Page
- All API calls now have a 30-second timeout using `Promise.race()`
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states maintained correctly
- Prevents the app from freezing during long responses

**Files Modified**:
- `app/cover/page.tsx` - Added timeout to handleGenerate(), handleRewrite(), handleCompare()
- `app/api/cover/generate/route.ts` - Created full implementation
- `app/api/cover/rewrite/route.ts` - Enhanced with mode support
- `app/api/cover/compare/route.ts` - Enhanced parameter handling

#### D. Supporting Files Created
- `lib/cover-store.ts` - Zustand store for cover letter state management
- `lib/normalize.ts` - Added `cleanCoverLetterText()` function
- `components/ui/tabs.tsx` - Tabs component implementation
- `app/api/generate-plaintext/route.ts` - Basic placeholder to prevent build errors

## Testing Checklist

✅ **error.tsx**: Has "use client" directive  
✅ **Build**: TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ **Linting**: No linter errors  
✅ **Timeout Handling**: Added to all API calls  
✅ **Loading States**: Maintained during long responses  
✅ **PDF Export**: Works with correct element ID  
✅ **max_tokens and temperature**: Kept as required (1000, 0.7)  
✅ **Mock Fallbacks**: Available when API key missing  

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ The app builds successfully  
✅ `/cover` loads without timeout  
✅ No ReactServerComponentsError  
✅ PDF download and AI generation function correctly  
✅ Timeout handlers prevent process from freezing  
✅ Loading states displayed during API calls  

## Changes Made

1. **API Route Implementation**:
   - Created comprehensive `/api/cover/generate` route
   - Enhanced `/api/cover/rewrite` with mode support
   - Enhanced `/api/cover/compare` with proper parameter handling

2. **Timeout Protection**:
   - All API calls wrapped with 30-second timeout using Promise.race()
   - Graceful error handling with user feedback
   - Loading states properly managed

3. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Created cover store for state management
   - Added text normalization utilities
   - Implemented tabs component
   - Fixed PDF export element ID

## Notes

- The timeout is set to 30 seconds which provides ample time for AI generation while preventing indefinite hangs
- All error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- PDF and DOCX export functionality is preserved and working
