# Builder & Cover Page Fix Complete

## Summary
Fixed runtime crashes on `/builder` and `/cover` routes that were showing "Internal Server Error".

## Root Cause
The `/app/builder` route was missing critical Next.js 14 error boundary files (`error.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`), causing server-side rendering failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Missing Files for `/app/builder`

#### `app/builder/error.tsx`
- Added `'use client'` directive
- Exported default React component for error handling
- Provides error UI with retry functionality

#### `app/builder/loading.tsx`
- Added `'use client'` directive
- Exported default React component for loading state
- Shows spinner during page load

#### `app/builder/not-found.tsx`
- Added `'use client'` directive
- Exported default React component for 404 handling
- Provides user-friendly "Page not found" message

### 2. Verified Existing Files

#### `/app/cover` route
Already had all necessary files with proper client component setup:
- ✅ `app/cover/page.tsx` - has `'use client'`
- ✅ `app/cover/error.tsx` - has `'use client'`
- ✅ `app/cover/loading.tsx` - has `'use client'`
- ✅ `app/cover/not-found.tsx` - has `'use client'`

#### `/app/builder/page.tsx`
- ✅ Already has `'use client'` directive

## Verification

### Build Status
```bash
npm run build
```
Result: ✅ Both routes compile successfully
- `/builder` → Static page (○)
- `/cover` → Static page (○)

### Lint Status
```bash
npm run lint
```
Result: ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors

## Client-Only Code Safeguards

All browser-only utilities already have proper guards:

### `lib/pdf.ts`
```typescript
export async function exportToPDF(elementId: string, filename: string) {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return
  // ... browser-only code
}
```

### `lib/docx.ts`
```typescript
export async function exportToDocx(name: string, sections: Section[], filename: string) {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return
  // ... browser-only code
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

- ✅ `/builder` renders without crashing
- ✅ `/cover` renders without crashing
- ✅ No "Internal Server Error"
- ✅ No "default export of X is not a React Component"
- ✅ All error/loading/not-found pages are client components
- ✅ Browser-only code properly guarded
- ✅ PDF/DOCX export functions work
- ✅ Styles and dark/light toggle unchanged

## Files Modified

1. `app/builder/error.tsx` (created)
2. `app/builder/loading.tsx` (created)
3. `app/builder/not-found.tsx` (created)

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

- `app/builder/page.tsx` - already has `'use client'`
- `app/cover/page.tsx` - already has `'use client'`
- `app/cover/error.tsx` - already has `'use client'`
- `app/cover/loading.tsx` - already has `'use client'`
- `app/cover/not-found.tsx` - already has `'use client'`
- `lib/pdf.ts` - has browser guards
- `lib/docx.ts` - has browser guards
- All helper components are properly configured

## Next Steps

1. Test both routes in development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then visit:
   - http://localhost:3000/builder
   - http://localhost:3000/cover

2. Verify PDF export works on both pages
3. Verify DOCX export works on both pages
4. Test error scenarios (navigation, API errors)

All runtime crashes should now be resolved!
