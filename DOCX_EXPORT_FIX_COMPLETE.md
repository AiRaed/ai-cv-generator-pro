# DOCX Export Fix - Complete

## Summary
Fixed the DOCX export button functionality in both CV Builder and Cover Letter Builder pages. The "saveAs is not a function" error has been completely resolved.

## Changes Made

### 1. lib/docx.ts - Fixed Download Mechanism
**Problem**: The `file-saver` import was causing "saveAs is not a function" errors.

**Solution**: Replaced `file-saver` dependency with native browser download API.

**Changes**:
- Added `downloadFile()` helper function using `URL.createObjectURL()` and programmatic link click
- This approach is more reliable and doesn't depend on external file-saver imports
- Maintains proper blob handling and cleanup

### 2. app/builder/page.tsx - Improved CV DOCX Export
**Changes**:
- Fixed success toast display after DOCX export
- Added contact information section to DOCX output
- Maintained filename format: `CV-[UserName]-[Date].docx`
- Enhanced document structure with proper sections (Contact Info, Summary, Experience, Education, Skills)
- Error handling shows specific error messages

### 3. app/cover/page.tsx - Fixed Cover Letter DOCX Export
**Changes**:
- Added success toast display after DOCX export
- Updated filename format to: `Cover-[Date].docx` (per requirements)
- Proper letter format with greeting and signature
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages

- Completely reliable file download mechanism

✅ **Success Notifications**
- Green success message appears after successful download
- Format: "✅ Export successful"

✅ **Proper Filenames**

- Cover Letter: `Cover-[Date].docx`

✅ **PDF Export Unchanged**

## Implementation Details

### Browser Download Function
```typescript
function downloadFile(blob: Blob, filename: string) {
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  const link = document.createElement('a')
  link.href = url
  link.download = filename
  document.body.appendChild(link)
  link.click()
  document.body.removeChild(link)
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
}
```

This approach:
- Uses only native browser APIs
- Creates an object URL from the blob
- Programmatically clicks a download link
- Properly cleans up the URL
- Works across all modern browsers

## Acceptance Criteria - All Met

✅ Clicking DOCX downloads a .docx file locally
✅ No console or red error appears
✅ PDF remains fully functional
✅ UI and layout are unchanged
✅ Success message displayed after download
✅ Proper filename patterns for both CV and Cover Letter

## Notes

- The solution avoids external dependencies for the download mechanism
- PDF export remains untouched and fully functional
- All existing design, buttons, and notifications are preserved
- Improved error messages provide better user feedback
