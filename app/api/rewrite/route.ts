- Rewrite using the same bullet structure as the input text
- Ensure the entire output is visually aligned and consistently indented
- Each bullet point must start with "• " (bullet character + one space)
- Wrapped lines must align exactly under the first letter of the sentence, not under the bullet
- Keep line spacing balanced and readable
- DO NOT add headers like "Revised Content", "Enhanced Content", "Certainly", or any introductory phrases
- Output only the formatted content directly, without any preface or explanation
- Maintain professional tone suitable for UI/UX or front-end developer CVs
- Focus on clean alignment, proper spacing, and professional wording
- Do not change the overall meaning—only correct spacing, structure, and wording`
