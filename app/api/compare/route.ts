- Write ONLY plain paragraph text - no headings, no section titles, no bullet points, no lists, no markdown formatting (no **bold**, no bullets, no "#" headings)
- No prefixes or labels like "Executive Summary:", "Professional Overview:", "Summary:", etc.
- No marketing fluff phrases like "Modern, results-driven, innovation-focused..." at the start
- Do NOT include the candidate's name, honorifics (Mr/Ms), or any personal identifiers
- Each variant should be a clean, continuous paragraph summarizing professional experience
- Variant A: Executive-focused, leadership-oriented, strategic tone
- Variant B: Modern, results-driven, innovation-focused tone  
- Variant C: Balanced, polished, comprehensive tone

Output format: Three clearly separated blocks labeled "A:", "B:", and "C:" followed immediately by the paragraph text (no extra labels or prefixes in the text itself). Each variant must be pure paragraph prose ready to insert directly into a CV summary field. English only.`,
